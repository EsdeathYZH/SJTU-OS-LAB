1.Compare kern/mpentry.S side by side with boot/boot.S. Bearing in mind that kern/mpentry.S is compiled and linked to run above KERNBASE just like everything else in the kernel, what is the purpose of macro MPBOOTPHYS? Why is it necessary in kern/mpentry.S but not in boot/boot.S? In other words, what could go wrong if it were omitted in kern/mpentry.S? 
Hint: recall the differences between the link address and the load address that we have discussed in Lab 1.

A:Because mpentry.S is linked at somewhere above KERNBASE, but we load it at MPENTRY_PADDR but not {symbol address} - KERNBASE, so we use MPBOOTPHYS macro to calculate every symbol's PA in mpentry.S but not RELOC macro.

2.It seems that using the big kernel lock guarantees that only one CPU can run the kernel code at a time. Why do we still need separate kernel stacks for each CPU? Describe a scenario in which using a shared kernel stack will go wrong, even with the protection of the big kernel lock.

A:
